This recipe provides a package for the Chromium web browser. It strives to
always follow the latest stable Linux release as listed in
https://omahaproxy.appspot.com

We refer to the web browser as Chromium, not Chrome, because "Chrome" is
Google's version of the web browser with proprietary content on top of the
open-source Chromium browser.

Since Chromium 58.0.3029.81, there is a build-time dependency on nodejs, which
is run on the host to preprocess a few files. This recipe has been tested with
the nodejs recipe from https://github.com/ostroproject/meta-iot-web.

Compared to a usual, smaller recipe, the Chromium recipe has a few
peculiarities:
- When DEBUG_BUILD is set, the Chromium binary is built with fewer debug
  symbols on 32-bit target architectures (i.e. the compiler is passed "-g1"
  instead of "-g"), as a binary with full debugging symbols is too big (~5Gb as
  of M58) for the information to be properly contained in the ELF32 headers of
  the binary, which breaks binutils and file(1).
- We manually patch parts of the build system to replace Chromium's bundled
  copies of some packages (flac, libjpeg and others) with system-wide ones.
- Parts of the V8 (Chromium's JavaScript engine) build need to run binaries
  built for the target, for which we use QEMU.

The "proprietary-codecs" PACKAGECONFIG option builds Chromium with support for
non-free multimedia codecs, such as H.264 and others. It is your responsibility
to make sure you are complying with the codecs' licensing terms.

Note: by default, Chromium will refuse to execute if run as root. During
testing, one can bypass the check by passing "--no-sandbox" to the chromium
binary. In production, one should NEVER run Chromium as root, but rather use a
separate, unprivileged user instead.
